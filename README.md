##python-ebay##

This is my Implementation of https://github.com/roopeshvaddepally/python-ebay
You should also consider using http://code.google.com/p/ebay-sdk-python/.
#
for now I am only adding trading api xml calls which was lacking in the original implementation
If you want to use this rather than https://github.com/roopeshvaddepally/python-ebay, please be sure to change the config.ini which might contain my sandbox user and token depending on if I forget to take them out.
